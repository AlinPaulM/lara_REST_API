KEY APPLICATION CREATION STEPS
---------------------------------
(project created with laravel 9.10.1, php 8.1.1, mysql 5.7.31)

-to install the latest version of laravel, make sure your pc(your terminal) is set up to use the php version required by the latest version of laravel(otherwise you will not get the latest version of laravel)
-install laravel using composer, run "composer create-project laravel/laravel myAppName"

-the .env config file can't be commited, we can't store credentials in our code(for obvious security reasons). But for the purpose of this app, i'll store all configuration in .env.example, so that when i run the "cp .env.example .env" step from the installation INSTRUCTIONS(from Readme.md), it'll copy all configuration to .env

-use phpmyadmin or whatever you want to create a database with the configuration found in .env.example (e.g. on a standard WAMP, all configuration is as in .env.example, so just create a "lara_rest_api" database in phpmyadmin)

-php artisan make:model Album -m
-php artisan make:model ImageManipulation -m
-php artisan make:controller AlbumController --model=Album --requests --api

versioning
-create apiResource route for album, with v1 prefix
-php artisan make:resource V1\\AlbumResource
-add V1 folder(manually, just cuz it was created wo versioning folder with the make:controller command) under app\Http\Controllers, move AlbumController.php in it, update AlbumController.php and routes\api.php to use the new V1 path

-php artisan make:controller V1\\ImageManipulationController --model=ImageManipulation --requests --api
-php artisan make:resource V1\\ImageManipulationResource
-delete ImageManipulationController's update(), delete UpdateImageManipulationRequest.php - cuz we don't have update support for this
-rename StoreImageManipulationRequest to ResizeImageRequest, update ImageManipulationController to reflect this, rename its store() to resize()
